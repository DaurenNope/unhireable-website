# Unhireable Roadmap

## What We Are Building Now

- Harden the current brutalist experience:
  - Stabilize authentication (credentials + OAuth).
  - Ensure matches, learning paths (demo data), and resume lab run end-to-end.
- Ship two flagship features that reinforce the core value:
  - **Hyper‑Personalized Learning Paths** — adaptive plans, daily actions, clear progress.
  - **Advanced Job Matching** — richer scoring (fit, growth potential, negotiation cues) on top of existing swiping flow.
- Instrument everything:
  - Analytics hooks for swipes, saves, learning-path opens, resume downloads.
  - Traces that prove stickiness and highlight drop-offs.
- Prepare marketing collateral that reflects the live product (screenshots, copy, CTA flow).

## What Comes Next (Vision)

1. **Career Intelligence Dashboard**
   - Real-time skill gap and market pulse metrics.
   - Progress velocity and benchmark comparisons.

2. **Mentorship & Community Layer**
   - AI-guided Q&A surfacing curated mentor content.
   - Role-based cohorts or “study squads” once we see demand.

3. **Predictive Career Analytics**
   - Promotion probability, job security, and pivot readiness signals tied to user data.

4. **Future Bets (Keep on the North Star)**
   - Immersive simulations (VR/AR), AI interview coach, automated portfolio builder.
   - Blockchain credentialing when we have meaningful proof points.
   - Neural adaptation learning loops (cognitive load, optimal timing) after we own the basics.

> Build, measure, and prove each layer before unlocking the next. No “spray-and-pray” feature pile; every release should deepen the rebellious, brutally honest promise.
